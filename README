                Quick and dirty ISMG145 reader 
    for Carlo Gavazzi's poorly documented photovoltaic inverters
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 You have found the first and only low cost DIY-solution to get data 
 from your Carlo Gavazzi ISMG145 solar power inverters.
 The solution was coined without any help from Carlo Gavazzi whatsoever
 in spite of my request for it.
 
 It is kinda up to you to select the components to put together. I can 
 tell you what I did. I got:
  * a raspberry-pi, casing, power supply and sd-card
    (any python-capable computer will probably do)
  * a five-dollar USB-to-RS485-adapter: http://www.dx.com/p/usb-to-rs485-adapter-black-green-296620
  * rj45-cable and plugs
  * an internet connection to the raspberry pi
  * a power plug to feed the raspberry

 If you need help, feel free to contact me - it will be well below the obscene
 DKK 4899 Gavazzi charges for their meter-reading solution (their reason for
 not supporting an open solution, I presume).
 
 # Install raspbian
 # sudo apt-get install python-pip
 # sudo pip install --upgrade pyserial
 # sudo pip install python-dateutil
 # sudo pip install python-crontab
 # sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server php5-mysql python-mysqldb (you will be asked to create a mysql-superuser password)
 # mysql -u root -p -e "create database ismgdata; grant all privileges on ismgdata.* TO gavazzireader@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'ismg';" (enter mysql-superuser password)
 # sudo apt-get install git
 # git clone https://github.com/gavazzireader/ismg.git
 # cd ismg
 # python gavazzireader.py --configure
 # python gavazzireader.py
  - verify data is fetched (check data files in data_dir)
 # python gavazzireader.py --cron

 
 For a local view of the data collected, you can make the files in the www subfolder available somewhere accessible via apache
